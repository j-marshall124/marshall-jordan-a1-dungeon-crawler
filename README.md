This ended up being a lot bigger than I expected.
Fully complete now and I'm pretty proud of how it turned out. There were some obstacles that I had to over come and some ideas and features I had to change or rethink in order to get everything working.
I would love to return to this project when I learn how to create a 'Game Over' so that the player can lose before reaching the end of the game.
Interested in learning ways to make the code more concise and simplified.
